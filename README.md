### The Problem
- Researchers across diverse fields grapple with understanding complex systems comprised of numerous interconnected variables and causal relationships.
- Traditional visualization methods, such as 2D diagrams and static displays, prove inadequate in capturing the intricate interplay of these factors.
- This limitation hinders comprehension of the system's dynamics, restricts exploration and analysis, and impedes effective knowledge sharing and collaboration.

### Our Solution
- Caspr (Causal Analysis and Structure Path Relationships) is a web application that empowers users to explore complex causal diagrams in an intuitive 3D environment.
- By transforming data into interactive visualizations, Caspr reveals intricate relationships between variables in multifaceted systems across diverse research domains, including machine learning, economics, environmental studies, and political science.
- Secure user accounts, graph sharing with permissions, and a dedicated explore page promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing. Simply upload a formatted JSON file to see the data come to life.

### Useful Links
- Try the application at [caspr.vercel.app](https://caspr.vercel.app/)
- See our demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aORwIygIAM)

## Key Features
- **Our Secure Account System**: Create an account and log in to securely save, manage, and share your graphs. Caspr uses Firebase Authentication to protect your information. Caspr allows login and account creation via Google, convenient password reset, and easy-to-use graph access control with permissions to ensure your data remains private and secure.

- **Dynamic 3D Graph Visualization**: Caspr brings causal diagrams to life! The 3D graph is generated dynamically from JSON data, where each node and edge represents crucial connections between elements. You can explore complex systems with ease.

- **Smooth Graph Interaction**: Navigate the graph in a fully immersive 3D space. Zoom, pan, and rotate the graph freely to explore relationships from every angle. It's simple and intuitive, letting you focus on discovering insights.

- **Node and Edge Information on Hover**: Curious about a specific node or edge? Just hover over it to see all the details, including node labels, categories, and edge relationships and strengths.

   <img src="/images/node_description.png" alt="Node Description" width="40%" height="40%">
 </div>

- **Powerful Filtering and Searching**: Customize your view with filtering based on connection strength, or search for nodes by name, category, or ID. The graph instantly adjusts to show exactly what you need.

- **Connection Type and Direction Indicators**: Easily differentiate between causal and inhibitory connections using color-coded edges (black for causal, red for inhibitory), and follow the arrows to see the direction of influence between nodes.

- **Graph Uploading and Sharing**: Upload JSON files to create custom causal graphs and choose to share them publicly, keep them private, or share to specific users. Additionally, use the generated public link to easily share your graph. To view graphs shared to you, view the shared with me page in the sidebar.

- **Explore Page**: Browse and explore public graphs created by other users.
